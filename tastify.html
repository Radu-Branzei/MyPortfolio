            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>tastify is a full-stack web application developed in Angular, with the use of Node.js for the backend
                server-side connection. It allows an user to connect with their Spotify account and view information
                about their most streamed artists/tracks, find information about the uniqueness of one's taste, get
                recommendations and some other. To make things more interactive, the platform allows the users to spot
                others with similar listening tendencies.
            <p>The app is built on Spotify's Spotify for Developers API, which offers programmers all the information
                needed to create such platforms.</p>

            <h3>Log In Protocol</h3>
            <p>To view the information needed, an user needs to connect to their Spotify account. Instead of directly
                entering the username and password and allowing for developers to get hold of them, the OAuth 2.0
                protocol allows the user to redirect to an external Spotify page, where the credidentials will be
                introduces and not passed forward.</p>
            <h3>Website features</h3>
            <p>
                Once the user successfully logs in, the home page will present them with 3 main sections:
                <li><b>Discover yourself!:</b> Get information about your most streamed artists/tracks over a chosen
                    period of time. Up to 50 instances can be presented at once.</li>
                <li><b>How unique are you!:</b> Depening on an average popularity score obtained from each of your songs
                    or artists, we can tell how niche your taste is compared to users worldwide.</li>
                <li><b>Find music you like!:</b> Introduce a list of up to 5 artists/tracks and looking at different
                    aspects of each, we'll create a list of songs that might fit your preferences.</li>
            </p>
            <p>Additional important features:
                <li>Automatic creation of an account: After the user logs in, the platform will automatically create an
                    account for them, keeping track of their listening history after Spotify refreshes it.</li>
                <li>Search bar: Enter a prompt and by pressing enter we'll display the most trendy artists/tracks and
                    additionally, existent users on the platform.</li>
                <li>Artist pages: Clicking on an artist card will open a dedicated page, showcasing their most
                    popular songs, albums, and other users listening to them.</li>
                <li>Track pages: Clicking on a track card will open a dedicated page, showcasing different musical
                    aspects of it (BPM, Key, Time Signature etc.), alongside other users listening to it.</li>
                <li>User pages: Clicking on another user's page will open their profile, where you can find artists and
                    tracks you both share listening to.</li>
                <li>
                    Player: The website has an additional music player which is active when the user has recently
                    connected to Spotify, allowing for music to be played directly from the platform.
                </li>
