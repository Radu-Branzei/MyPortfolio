            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>Full-stack app web application developed in Angular, with the use of ASP.NET web technologies for the
                backend server-side connection. Players can create rooms, join existing ones and play real-time
                turn-based games of the board game Ludo.
            <h3>How to join a game</h3>
            <p>
                <li>After entering the starting page, insert an username and choose one of the two options: Join Lobby
                    or Create New Lobby.</li>
                <li>Insert the ID of an existing lobby in the case of joining an existing one. (The ID will have to be
                    personally transmitted by the host.)</li>
                <li>
                    In the case of a host, wait for more players to join and be ready, then press Start Game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the case of a guest, click Ready and wait for the host to start the game.
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>The multiplayer lobby system allows players to create or join game rooms, invite friends, and manage game
                settings before starting a match. Players can chat with each other in the lobby, view available game
                rooms, and join ongoing matches.</p>
            </p>

            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>
                <li>Wait for your turn, you are unable to interact with the interface if it's another player's turn.
                </li>
                <li>Roll the dice.</li>
                <li>Click one of your pieces. It will move a corresponding amount of squares, according to the dice
                    result.</li>
                <li>Landing on another player's square will knock their piece to the very beginning.</li>
                <li>The exact number of remaining squares will have to be rolled for a piece to reach the final spot,
                    the triangle.</li>
                <li>Once a player gets all their pieces inside the triangle, they have officially finished the game,
                    allowing the others to continue until only one loser is left.</li>
            </p>
            <p>(NOTE: This was a team project consisting of two people with equal contributions. I take most of the
                responsibility for the
                frontend side, the responsive design and the connection with the objects created in the backend
                counterpart.)
